# SuperchargeTest
## *To see a best version of this, see the branch bestVersion, where I solved some of the problems of this version after the 3 hour deadline

## Issues that I couldn't solve within the 3 hours deadline (but I will solve later):
    - Get DateFormatter to recognize the given date format - when I solve that, I can get the start time of the programme (now is only with a placeholder) and the duration of each one of them (to adjust the cell width accordingly)
    - Something happened that all the channels are with the same programme list.

## To improve my UI I would:
    - Change the colors (I liked the color scheme in the given example)
    - Add a something to separate the title from the list of programmes (may be change the channel title background color and make it with the height of the cell or add a little vertical line bar to do that.
    - Add a little bar displaying every hour of the day, so when you scroll it all the collection views in all of the cells move too (so the user can search based on the time in all of the visible channels on the screen at once).
